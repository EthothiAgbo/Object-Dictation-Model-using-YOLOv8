# Flask Object Detection with YOLOv8

This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload videos and performs real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model. The application also supports live object detection through a webcam.

## **Features**
- **Video Upload and Processing**: Users can upload video files, which will be analyzed for object detection.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect objects in frames from a webcam or video feed.
- **Dynamic HTML Interface**: A user-friendly webpage to upload videos and view detection results.
- **Expandable**: Easily adaptable to add new features, such as saving results or enhancing object detection capabilities.
